# Interactive Calculus Learning Website

This project is an interactive, research-backed calculus learning platform designed for both beginners and advanced learners. It combines visualizations, real-world examples, and metacognitive prompts to foster deep understanding and engagement.

## ðŸ“š Content Structure & Educational Rules

Each major calculus topic (Functions, Slope, Derivatives, Differentiation Rules, Integrals) follows a strict, consistent structure:

### 1. Dual-Level Approach
- **Beginner Level:**
  - Simple, accessible explanations
  - Real-world example relevant to everyday life
  - Metacognitive prompt (reflection or prediction)
- **Advanced Level:**
  - Deeper, formal explanations
  - Real-world example from science, economics, or advanced math
  - Metacognitive prompt (reflection or prediction)

### 2. Visual + Textual Pairing
- Every topic includes an interactive visualizer.
- Explanations and prompts reference the visualizer directly, encouraging experimentation and exploration.

### 3. Math Dictionary (Glossary)
- Each topic section starts with a collapsible **Math Words** box.
- This glossary defines all key terms for that topic, supporting both beginners and advanced learners.

### 4. Real-World Examples
- Both levels (beginner and advanced) feature concrete, relatable real-world scenarios.
- Examples are integrated into the topic, not presented separately.

### 5. Metacognitive Prompts
- Every level in every topic includes a reflection or prediction prompt.
- These encourage students to self-explain, predict, or connect concepts to their own experience.

## ðŸ§© How to Contribute or Extend Content

- **Add a New Topic:**
  1. Create a new section/component following the dual-level structure.
  2. Include a Math Words glossary at the top.
  3. Provide a real-world example and a metacognitive prompt for both beginner and advanced levels.
  4. Integrate a visualizer or interactive element.

- **Improve an Existing Topic:**
  - Ensure both beginner and advanced levels are present and complete.
  - Check for a glossary, real-world examples, and prompts at both levels.
  - Keep explanations clear and reference the visualizer.

- **Glossary Updates:**
  - Add or clarify definitions as needed, but keep language accessible.
